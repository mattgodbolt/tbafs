Okay this is !Blurp - a quick game myself and a friend rustled up when
we were bored...

Points to note :

(1) It's unfinished ...

(2) It's currently fiddled to work on VGA monitors and probably goes haywire
    on any other monitor.

(3) I can't be bothered to write any instructions ... apart from use SPACE
    to start (not 1 or 2), z and x, SHIFT and return.  Kill the nasties and
    collect the pods they leave behind.  That's it.  Oh and press e on the
    title page to edit levels.

(4) It goes bananas on RPC's - you can try tho' for fun :)

Enjoy - comments back to me (M.R.Godbolt@ex.ac.uk)
